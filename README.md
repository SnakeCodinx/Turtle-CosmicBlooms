# Cosmic Blooms

This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a beautiful, intricate pattern that appears to bloom and swirl like a flower in the cosmos. The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected circles with increasing radii, with each circle being drawn in a different color from the HSV color space. The colorsys module is used to convert HSV values to RGB colors, creating a smooth transition between colors.

# Features
Swirling colors: The pattern features a vibrant, swirling palette of colors that shift smoothly from one hue to the next.
Flower-like shape: The circles are drawn in a way that creates a flower-like shape, with each petal overlapping the previous one.
Increasing complexity: The pattern becomes increasingly complex as the circles get larger, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality.


# Run
To run this code, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., cosmic_blooms.py) and execute it using Python (e.g., python cosmic_blooms.py). This will launch a window displaying the Cosmic Blooms pattern.
